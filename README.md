DoctestAll
==========

Recursive doctest-executing library and script for running doctest on projects.

DoctestAll is a very simple solution for running unit tests a package at a time,
recursively descending with the ```__all__``` module property to find children
to analyze. Or audit, if you want a creepy scientology metaphor.

DTA is available as the ```doctestall``` module, and a script by the same name
which can be run from the command line.
